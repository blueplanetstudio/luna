//! # Luna: A software design tool without compromises.
//!
//! Luna is local, files on disk first. Own your own data,
//! collaborate, design on the canvas or write code.
//!
//! It's not a design tool, or a code editor, it's a tool
//! for designing software:
//!
//! That means not just pixels, but representative screens and flows
//! using an abstractionless design and editing experience.
//!
//! If Luna is a design tool for everyone I'll have failed in my
//! goals â€“ it should be as complex as it needs to be without
//! trade-offs in service of making it easier to use.
