        // This explains the issue described by the user:
        // 1. Nodes positioned at (0,0) in the coordinate system appear at the center of the viewport
        // 2. The grid's origin (0,0) is drawn at the center correctly
        // 3. Nodes loaded from files that were created with the expectation that (0,0) is the top-left 
        //    appear to be offset from the grid origin by approximately (-viewport_width/2, -viewport_height/2)
        // 
        // Specific to the user's report: They observed their node from single_element.json claiming to be at (0,0)
        // was actually rendered at (-500, -350) relative to the grid's origin, which matches our expected behavior
        // since 500 ≈ 1000/2 and 350 ≈ 800/2, or half the viewport dimensions.
