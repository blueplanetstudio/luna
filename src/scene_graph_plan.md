High-Level Architectural Changes
	1.	Evolve from a Strict Tree to a DAG/Instance Model
	•	Introduce Component Definitions vs. Instances:
Define two kinds of nodes or separate node types:
	•	Component/Definition Node: A master template that’s stored only once.
	•	Instance Node: A lightweight wrapper that references the master instead of duplicating its entire structure.
	•	Reference Linking:
Replace the “one parent” assumption. Ensure that an instance node only stores its instance-specific data (e.g., transforms, override values) while all visual content comes from the component definition.
	2.	Integrate Lazy Updates with Dirty Flags
	•	Marking for Update:
Add a flag (or flags) on each node that marks when a transform or bounds value is “dirty” (i.e., out‑of‑date).
	•	Lazy Computation:
Instead of updating every node eagerly on every change, propagate the dirty flag downward and recalc values only when required (e.g., on rendering or hit testing).
	3.	Unify Scene Graph and Data Model (or Ensure Tight Mapping)
	•	Stable IDs & Mapping:
Ensure every node has a persistent ID (both for the scene graph and for the backing data model).
	•	Single Source of Truth:
Decide whether to let the scene graph be the runtime model or have the scene graph remain an optimized “view” with proper synchronization mechanisms. In either case, the mapping between the two must be robust to avoid data drift.
	4.	Plan for Future Collaboration
	•	Fine-Grained Operations:
Make sure all operations (insertions, removals, property updates) are isolated so they can later be converted into atomic changes or operations in a collaboration system.
	•	Order & Concurrency:
Consider how you might represent child ordering (e.g. using fractional indices) to help when merging concurrent edits.

	•	Allow instance nodes to hold only pointers (IDs or references) to component definitions plus an override map.
	•	Update your current SlotMap or similar storage to allow multiple references to the same definition node.
	2.	Incorporate Dirty Flags for Transform and Bounds
	•	Add a dirty: bool flag (or separate flags for transforms and bounds) to each node.
	•	Modify set_local_transform (and similar methods) to mark the node (and its descendants) as dirty rather than immediately updating every child.
	•	Write functions to “flush” or update all dirty nodes only when needed.
	3.	Create a Robust Mapping Between Data Model and Scene Graph
	•	Ensure that every scene graph node carries the unique ID of its corresponding data model node.
	•	Build functions to update the scene graph when the data model changes (and vice versa) in a modular way, so you can later switch to a unified system if beneficial.

	•	Modify the API for adding children so it can detect when you’re inserting an instance node.
	•	Implement cycle detection carefully with the new graph structure.

	5.	Implement Unit Tests & Integration Tests Throughout
	•	For every new function or modification, write tests (see below).
	6.	Conduct Performance Profiling & Optimization
	•	Once basic functionality is in place, create benchmark tests to see if lazy updates and instance resolution perform well on large document trees.
	7.	Design for Collaboration (Data Operations Layer)
	•	Abstract all scene graph operations into a set of commands (e.g., “insert node,” “update property”) that will later be translatable into operations for a real-time collaboration system.
	•	Ensure each command is testable on its own.

Testing Strategy and Useful Test Coverage

Test Structure
	1.	Unit Tests per Function/Module
	•	Write tests for each core function (e.g., node creation, cycle detection, transform composition, dirty flag propagation).
	•	Use Rust’s built-in testing framework to create clear unit tests that validate small units of behavior.
	2.	Integration Tests for the Scene Graph
	•	Create tests that build entire scene graphs, perform a series of operations, and then assert the final state.
	•	Simulate typical user workflows (e.g., create a component definition, insert several instances, update the master, and verify that the instances reflect changes if no override is set).
	3.	Property-Based Testing
	•	Use property-based testing (like the quickcheck crate) to generate random trees or DAGs, perform random operations (insertions, removals, updates), and then check invariants (e.g., no cycles, correct transform propagation).
	4.	Performance & Stress Tests
	•	Write tests that build large scene graphs (thousands of nodes) to ensure that transformation updates and hit testing perform within acceptable limits.
	•	These tests may not run with every commit but should be part of your continuous integration suite.

What to Test
	•	Correctness of Hierarchy Operations:
	•	Adding and removing nodes.
	•	Making sure the parent–child relationships are maintained.
	•	Cycle detection: Trying to reparent nodes must properly detect and block cycles.
	•	Transform Propagation:
	•	Ensure that updating a node’s local transform results in correct world transform computations for it and its descendants.
	•	Validate the lazy update mechanism: after marking a node as dirty, the world transform is recalculated only when needed.
	•	Bounds Computation:
	•	Test the bounds calculation of individual nodes and verify that world bounds accurately reflect the composed transform.
	•	Include cases with scaling, rotations, and translations.
	•	Instance and Component Behavior:
	•	Test creation of a component (definition) and instance node.
	•	Validate that an update to a component definition propagates to all instances that have not overridden specific properties.
	•	Test that instance overrides work as expected (i.e., they override the master’s properties without breaking the link).
	•	Mapping Between Data Model and Scene Graph:
	•	Verify that for every data model node, the correct scene graph node is returned (and vice versa).
	•	Test that changes in the data model correctly update the scene graph and that the mapping remains consistent.
	•	Edge Cases and Error Handling:
	•	Removing nodes that don’t exist.
	•	Reparenting nodes under various conditions (including invalid operations).
	•	Handling null references gracefully.
	•	Simulated Collaborative Sequences:
	•	Although real-time collaboration isn’t built yet, simulate a series of operations (e.g., reordering, concurrent-like insertions and removals) and assert that the scene graph remains in a consistent state.

Structuring the Tests
	•	Test Suites:
Organize tests into suites by functionality, for example:
	•	Hierarchy Tests: For insertion, deletion, reparenting, and cycle prevention.
	•	Transform & Bounds Tests: For verifying mathematical correctness of transform propagation and bounds computations.
	•	Instance & Component Tests: Covering component creation, instance referencing, and override propagation.
	•	Data Mapping Tests: Ensuring bidirectional consistency between your scene graph and data model.
	•	Use Mocks and Fakes Where Necessary:
For isolated tests, you can mock out parts of the system (like the data model) to test the scene graph in isolation.
For integration tests, build sample full scenes.
	•	Automated Continuous Integration:
Set up a CI pipeline that runs all these tests on every commit and measure code coverage to ensure your tests exercise both common and edge cases.

Final Summary and Next Steps
	1.	Refactor your node model: Introduce explicit component definitions and instance nodes to move from a strict tree toward a DAG model.
	2.	Implement lazy update logic: Use dirty flags to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
	3.	Tighten your data model/scene graph integration: Ensure robust mapping with stable IDs.
	4.	Design your API for fine-grained operations: This paves the way for later collaboration features.
	5.	Build a comprehensive test suite: Unit tests for every function, integration tests for user workflows, property-based tests for invariants, and performance tests for scale.

By following this roadmap and carefully structuring your tests, you’ll build a scene graph that not only meets the immediate spatial organization needs but also scales to support reusable components and collaboration in the long term.

---

Hierarchical Scene Graph Structure

Your current strict tree hierarchy is a natural starting point, but it may hit limits as the design grows. A pure tree means each node has exactly one parent, which prevents sharing subtrees. This is at odds with reusable components: an instance by definition wants to reuse the same content in multiple places. If your scene graph remains a strict tree, you’d have to duplicate the entire component subtree for each instance, which is both memory-heavy and hard to keep in sync. In large documents (Figma files can be hundreds of MB in memory ￼), such duplication doesn’t scale. The typical remedy is to allow a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure instead of a plain tree. A DAG-based scene graph lets multiple parent nodes reference the same child subtree, enabling one definition to be drawn in many places without cloning ￼. In practice, this means rethinking your node model so that a node can be instanced multiple times. If the current design assumes a single parent (e.g. storing a parent pointer in each node), that’s a fundamental mismatch with the needs of component reuse. You would likely need to refactor to either support multiple parent references or introduce an indirection (see below) for instancing. Without this, implementing Figma-like components will be cumbersome and error-prone (e.g. keeping copied trees in sync manually). The hierarchy approach is otherwise fine for grouping and transformations, but plan for a DAG or another instancing mechanism to avoid a dead-end on reuse ￼.

Reusable Components & Instance Support

Right now, the scene graph doesn’t appear to have a concept of “component definitions” and “instances.” This is a major gap if you want Figma-style reusable components. In a scalable design, you’d want to represent a component’s structure once, and then create lightweight instances that reference it. Some systems handle this by distinguishing Definition vs. Instance: a Definition is a master template (a subtree of nodes), and each Instance is a special node that references that template plus a transform ￼. Your architecture should evolve similarly. If you keep the scene graph separate from the model, one approach is to have the data model hold the component’s content (perhaps as a sub-tree or separate asset), and then the scene graph can contain “Instance nodes” that point to that component data. The instance node would not duplicate all the child nodes; it would act as a proxy that, when rendering or hit-testing, resolves to the component’s children with the instance’s transform applied. This avoids redundant copies and ensures that editing the master updates all instances. It also naturally fits a DAG scene graph (one master subtree, multiple instance parents).

If you don’t implement a DAG/reference scheme, the alternative is cloning the component’s nodes into each instance. That can work initially (and might simplify implementation of per-instance overrides), but it’s inefficient and requires a lot of bookkeeping to propagate changes. For example, if the user edits the master component, you’d have to push that change to every clone. This gets complex fast. The cleaner long-term solution is to bake reuse into the scene graph design now. Consider introducing an explicit Component (or Symbol) construct in the model, and an Instance node type in the scene graph that holds an ID or pointer to the component’s data plus its own transform and override data. This will make it much easier later to support bulk updates, swaps, and other component operations. In summary, instances need first-class support in the architecture – either via a DAG scene graph or a clear separation of component definitions vs. instance nodes ￼. Not planning for this now is a fundamental design flaw if you intend to have robust reuse.

Additionally, think about override handling in instances. Figma allows overriding certain properties in an instance without breaking the link. This implies your data model for an Instance might store a small set of overridden property values, while all other properties are inherited from the master component. Your scene graph (being primarily spatial) might not deal with the override logic directly, but it should allow an instance’s subtree to differ slightly. If you choose the “clone on instance” route initially, you’ll get override ability for free (since the clone is a normal node you can edit), but you’ll struggle to sync changes from the master. If you choose the reference/DAG route, you’ll need a way to overlay overrides – e.g. the Instance node could carry a map of property overrides that the renderer applies on top of the master’s content. This is a complex area, but it’s better to sketch a plan for overrides now so the scene graph can accommodate it (perhaps by allowing certain properties of instance children to be replaced or post-processed).

Transformation & Bounds Propagation

Propagating transforms down the tree and computing bounds up the tree is core to any scene graph, and your implementation will make or break performance as documents scale. A potential inefficiency is if every change triggers a full recalculation through the hierarchy. For example, moving a group at the top could force recalculating world transforms for thousands of nodes underneath on each frame. If your current code walks the entire subtree on every transform change, this might become a bottleneck. A common solution is to use dirty flags or lazy computation: mark subtrees as “dirty” when an ancestor’s transform changes, but don’t immediately recompute everything until needed (e.g. until rendering or hit-testing queries that require the updated values) ￼. This way, multiple changes can coalesce, and unchanged parts of the scene graph aren’t revisited unnecessarily. Make sure your scene graph nodes cache their world transform (global matrix) and bounding box, and only update those when a parent or the node’s own transform/property changes. The dirty-flag pattern is mentioned in many canvas/graphics tutorials because it drastically improves performance for retained-mode UIs ￼. If you haven’t already, consider implementing a system where each node has a needs_update flag for its world matrix and bounds. On a change, propagate a flag down instead of recomputing immediately. Then, on render/hit-test, update any dirty nodes. This will be important for smooth interactions, especially if you introduce animations or live previews.

Another aspect is the algorithmic complexity of hit-testing and layout. A naive hit-test that traverses the entire tree of thousands of nodes to find what’s under the cursor will become slow. Right now you may be fine with a simple tree walk (especially if you use bounding boxes to prune branches), but keep in mind large files. Eventually, you might need a spatial index (e.g. an R-tree or quadtree for selectable objects) to speed this up. The current design is okay since it’s separate from the model (meaning you could swap out the hit-test structure later), but note that a pure hierarchical traversal might not hold up. Similarly, if you plan to implement features like constraint-based layout or auto-layout (like Figma’s autolayout frames), the scene graph will need to handle recomputing layouts on parent/child changes. This could mean integrating layout solvers or constraints into the scene graph update process. There’s no immediate flaw in having transform propagation in the graph – that’s standard – but watch out for performance at scale and be ready to augment the approach with caching and selective updates.

One more consideration: by keeping the scene graph purely spatial, you might be duplicating some data or bouncing between structures. For example, if the data model also stores each object’s local transform (likely it does), and the scene graph stores the world transform, you need to maintain consistency. Ensure that whenever a transform in the model changes, you have a clear path to update the scene graph node (or mark it dirty). It may be beneficial to centralize transform logic so you’re not doing it twice. Some architectures let the scene graph be the authority on transforms and the model just holds other properties. Whatever you choose, ensure there’s not a lot of redundant computation between the two layers.

Scene Graph vs. Data Model Separation

You’ve intentionally separated the scene graph from the core data model, viewing the scene graph as an auxiliary structure for rendering and spatial operations. In theory this separation can enforce a clean design (the scene graph could be thrown away and rebuilt from the model, for example), but over-separation can lead to inefficiency and complexity. The key question: is the scene graph the source of truth for anything, or strictly a derived cache of the model? If it’s strictly derived, you’ll need robust sync logic for every edit. If the model is authoritative, every change (move object, resize, change z-order, etc.) must update the model, then update the scene graph. This dual maintenance can slow things down and introduce bugs (e.g. model and scene getting out of sync). On the other hand, if you blur the lines and let the scene graph be part of the model (like how Figma’s “scenegraph” is actually their document structure ￼), you simplify state management at the cost of tighter coupling. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but re-examine how much benefit you get from the strict separation. If you find yourself duplicating the entire layer hierarchy in both the model and scene graph, that’s a red flag – you might be better off merging them or at least using one as the backing for the other. For instance, you could use the data model for persistence/collab, but use the scene graph nodes directly as the live objects in memory (with pointers back to immutable model data for things like properties). This way, you’re not storing two copies of the hierarchy.

Currently, you note the scene graph is explicitly separate and only meant for spatial tasks. That suggests the model has its own representation of hierarchy and transforms. In the long run, maintaining two parallel hierarchies is fragile. It might be okay with careful discipline (many game engines separate an immutable asset graph from an instance graph, for example), but in a design tool context, the separation isn’t always clear-cut. For example, consider deletion or reordering of layers: the model will remove or move an item; the scene graph must do the same. Do you have unique IDs or references linking model objects to scene nodes? You absolutely should. That mapping is what will save you from inconsistencies. Figma’s internal model gives every object a unique ID and treats the document essentially as a map of properties per ID ￼, which makes it easy to sync changes and refer to objects across systems. If you haven’t already, embed stable identifiers in your model and let the scene graph nodes either store those IDs or a pointer to the model object. This way, if an update comes in (say, the model’s X coordinate of object 42 changes), you can find the scene node for 42 and update it. Without such linkage, a separated scene graph will be very hard to keep in sync in a complex application.

Also consider practicality vs. purity: The stated goal was to do “whatever is best for long-term scale — not necessarily strict” separation. This implies you’re open to relaxing the abstraction for the sake of performance or simplicity. In practice, a common approach is to let the scene graph be the in-memory model, augmented with whatever extra spatial indexing or caches needed. The “data model” in this case might just be a serialized form or a higher-level logical model, but at runtime you operate directly on the scene graph nodes. This is essentially what the browser DOM does (the DOM is the data model and scene graph combined), and what Figma’s description of their scenegraph suggests ￼. The benefit is that you eliminate duplicate structures and reduce update friction. The downside is that it entangles rendering/state with data, which can make non-visual operations (like computing differences for collaboration or undo) a bit trickier – but not terribly so if designed carefully. My recommendation is to at least unify the hierarchy: don’t keep two separate trees of children. Use one tree (perhaps the scene graph) as the master structure, and have the other “model” objects reference those or live on them. If you need to keep certain data abstracted (for example, business logic separate from render info), you can still split at the object level – e.g. each node has a pointer to a data object with non-visual properties. That way you maintain a separation of concerns without a separation of existence. In summary, a bit more integration could save a lot of headache. As you scale up (files with thousands of nodes, multiple pages, etc.), the efficiency of having a single unified structure will outweigh a purist MVC separation.

Collaboration & Real-Time Editing Readiness

Even though you’re not building real-time collaboration now, it’s wise that you’re thinking ahead. Certain architectural decisions made now will determine if collaboration is relatively straightforward or a nightmare. The good news is that a scene graph lends itself to representing document state in a way that can be shared. But there are some specific considerations:
	•	Stable Identity: As mentioned above, every object needs a stable ID that can be used to track it across collaborators and sessions. If your scene graph nodes are recreated or have no fixed ID, collaboration will suffer. Ensure that your data model generates persistent unique IDs for every element (including components and possibly even each instance’s sub-node if you go with instance clones). These IDs will be the primary keys for merging changes. Figma’s collab system literally treats the document as a map of properties by object ID ￼. Your architecture should make it possible to address any element by ID and apply property changes to it. That likely means your scene graph nodes carry the ID of the model object they represent.
	•	Operation Granularity: Real-time collaboration operates on fine-grained operations (property changes, node insertions/deletions, reorders). Your scene graph API should be able to handle individual property updates efficiently. For example, setting the fill color of a shape should not require rebuilding the whole graph or recomputing everything – it should ideally just mark that node as needing a repaint. If currently your scene graph is more monolithic (e.g. reconstructing on changes), you’ll want to move toward incremental updates. Each node being separate and addressable helps with this. It sounds like you do propagate bounds and such per node, which is good.
	•	Ordering and Hierarchy Changes: Merging concurrent edits to a tree structure is tricky. One known solution (used by Figma) is fractional indexing for node order ￼. Rather than relying on array indices that can conflict when two people insert layers at the same position, each node’s order can be represented by a value between its neighbors (so two inserts at the “same” spot get unique fractional positions). You don’t need to implement that now, but be aware that how you represent the child order in the model will impact collaborative merges. It might be as simple as each node having a floating-point sort key or a linked-list ordering that can handle concurrent inserts. The takeaway: design your model (and scene graph) so that reordering a node is an isolated operation (e.g. updating an index property on that node and maybe its immediate neighbors) rather than a wholesale re-listing of all children. If your scene graph stores children in a simple Vec/Array, that’s fine for now, but be ready to evolve that for collab (perhaps by assigning an order token per child).
	•	Deterministic Rebuilds: If the scene graph is ephemeral (rebuilt from the model state), ensure that given the same model state (which could result from merging collab changes), you always build the same scene graph. This is important so that all collaborators see the same result for the same data. It sounds obvious, but subtle differences (like non-deterministic iteration order if you used hashmaps for children, etc.) could cause divergence. Using a clear tree structure with sorted order (as you have) avoids most of this. Just keep in mind that with instances, if you go the route of duplicating subtrees for them, those duplicates must be created in a consistent way on each client. Another reason to prefer a reference model for instances – less chance of divergent state, since the single source is the component definition.
	•	Minimizing State that’s Not in the Model: For smooth collaboration, the model should encompass almost all of the document state, so that syncing it reproduces what others see. If the scene graph holds important info that isn’t in the model (for example, if a group’s bounding box is stored only in the scene graph, or an instance’s resolved children only live in the scene graph), then your collaboration engine would have to transmit or recreate that. It’s okay if the scene graph has derived data (like cached transforms, etc.), as those can be recomputed from the model deterministically. Just be wary of any state that a collaborator might need to see that isn’t coming from the shared model. For instance, if you eventually allow per-user selections or viewports, those should be clearly separated (so they aren’t conflated with document state). In summary, keep the authoritative state in the data model, and treat the scene graph as a projection of it. This aligns with CRDT/OT principles where the model (with IDs and properties) is what gets merged ￼.

In terms of your current architecture: if you do decide to unify the scene graph and model more, you can still satisfy the above by ensuring that unified structure has the right properties (IDs, fine-grained ops, etc.). If you keep them separate, then robust mapping between them is essential. Collaboration will test the integrity of your architecture – any inconsistency between model and scene graph will become a bug when state is merged from multiple sources. So it might actually be safer long-term to collapse the distinction and use one primary structure. Many collaborative systems use a single underlying model (often tree-structured) with unique IDs, and then build views or caches on top. That’s essentially what Figma does ￼. Given that, a practical evolution could be: move toward using the scene graph as the in-memory source of truth (with each node carrying all the properties from the model). Then your collaboration system would operate on that graph (with appropriate lock-free or merge mechanisms per property). This would eliminate the need to sync two different representations. It’s a significant architectural shift, but it aligns with long-term scalability in a multiplayer environment.

Performance and Scaling Considerations

Finally, evaluate if any core assumptions will bottleneck at scale. We’ve touched on some (transform propagation, duplication, etc.), but a holistic check is wise. If your scene graph is naïve in certain ways, large documents will expose it. For example, if you recompute every node’s world transform on every frame even when nothing changed, that’s wasted work – consider event-driven updates or partial re-renders. If your hit-testing always starts at the root and examines every node, consider spatial partitioning or at least an early-out using cached bounds. Also, memory usage will matter: a design file with thousands of objects and many instances could strain RAM if you keep too much per node. Try to keep the scene node lightweight (position, size, pointers, maybe a bitmask of flags, etc.) and store heavier data (like path geometry, image references, etc.) in a shared resource. This also plays into reuse – e.g. a component’s geometry should ideally be stored once, not N times. A DAG approach helps ensure non-redundancy of data ￼. If you go with duplication for instances, at least consider deduplicating resources (like a shared fill or text style object referenced by each). Many modern UI frameworks use composition over inheritance – i.e. a node might have components like a Transform component, Style component, etc., which could be shared. Rust’s ecosystem sometimes leverages ECS (Entity-Component Systems) for this kind of flexibility. An ECS might be overkill here, but the idea of not hard-coding one object = one visual element is useful when thinking about reuse and overrides.

In terms of raw rendering performance, think about how the scene graph will feed into rendering. If you plan on a retained-mode renderer (which it sounds like, since you have a scene graph), you might eventually implement optimizations like culling (skipping rendering of off-screen nodes) or level of detail (maybe not relevant for a design tool as much as for game engines). Culling would require an efficient way to traverse only visible portions of the graph – again, spatial indexing or an organized tree of bounds. The current architecture with propagated bounds is a good start: you can traverse and skip children whose parent bounds are off-screen. Just ensure those bounds are kept updated correctly. If your bounds propagation is wrong or slow, it will either cull incorrectly or not cull at all, hurting performance.

Lastly, be mindful of multi-user scenarios on the performance side: If two collaborators are editing different parts of the document, your architecture should allow those changes to be applied (and rendered) independently without interfering. For example, if user A is editing a component that user B has 50 instances of, when that update comes in, it will invalidate a large portion of B’s scene. Your design with proper instancing can handle this more gracefully (update the one definition, then either re-propagate to instance nodes or simply re-render them since they reference the updated definition). A less prepared design (with duplicated instances) would have to iterate over all those instance copies to update them, which could introduce lag. So performance and collaboration concerns intersect: batch your updates and avoid O(n) cascading effects where possible. If a property change doesn’t affect layout (say, changing color), it shouldn’t cause a full re-layout or anything. If it does affect layout (say, changing text content might resize a text box), try to scope the recalculation to just that subtree.

In summary, your draft scene graph is a reasonable starting point but has some architectural mismatches with the long-term goals: a strictly separate, purely tree-based scene graph will make components and collaboration harder. The good news is you can address these by introducing more flexibility now – embrace a DAG or reference system for instances, consider unifying or tightly linking the scene graph with the data model (with unique IDs and incremental updates), and build in the expectation of large, collaborative documents. Don’t be afraid to refactor early; core design assumptions (like “one node = one parent” or “scene graph is just a throwaway view”) can become expensive mistakes later. By moving toward a model where the scene graph is the live document structure (augmented with caches) and supports instancing, you set yourself up for success: it will handle reuse naturally and can be made collaboration-friendly with proper ID and property tracking ￼ ￼. Each of the areas above – hierarchy, instancing, transforms, data separation, collaboration – has specific pitfalls, but with the adjustments suggested, your architecture will be much better aligned with a Figma-like tool that scales in complexity and user count. Keep the critique in mind as you iterate, and you’ll avoid painting yourself into a corner as the app grows. Good luck!
